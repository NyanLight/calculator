# THE CALCULATOR

This is the calculator web app built in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS by me. 

## Key features

* **Keyboard support** You can use your keyboard instead the mouse to do evaluations much faster.
* **Calculation chain** It's not nessecary to press an equal button every time you decide to run operation. (I spent a lot of time when develop it :D ).
* **Float numbers** It's possible to do floating-point arithmetic.
